WITCHLING'S LOG 1 - January, 2023

- 👋 Hello, I’m @the-digital-witchling, a sprouting Canada based web developer.
- 👀 I am teaching myself how to code by using free online self learning resources such as The ODIN Project and the 100 Devs tutorials. I also use Jon Duckett's coding books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
- 💞️ I’m hoping to collaborate on projects with others in the future.
